## Project Overview
This project incorporated a dynamic and interactive visualization dashboard and charts using Plotly.js with a human belly button diversity dataset. Interactive dashboard and charts display bacteria that live inside the human body. Upon selection of an id number in a pull down list, the id metadata will be displayed in a div element and the top ten bacterial samples will be displayed in a pie chart and bubble chart.
